20.3  	a) Collection : interface implemented by generic classes 
		b) Collections : collections class extend collection interface and defines some common methods used in collections subclasses
		c) Comparator : comparator interface use to sort collection in natural order or any of given order.
		d) List : interface implements collection interface use to mainpulate array as list
		e) load factor : The load factor is a measure of how full the hash table is allowed to get before its capacity is automatically increased.
		f) HashMap : it is a class use to manipulate map implements map interface.
		
20.4	a) add : append element at the end of Vector.
		b) set : Replaces the element at the specific position.  
		c) remove : Removes the element at the specific position.
		d) removeAllElements : Removes all components from the vector and sets size to zero.
		e) removeElementAt : Deletes the component at the specific position.
		f) firstElement : Returns the first component of vector.
		g) lastElement : Returns the last component of vector.
		h) contains : Returns true if the vector contains the specific element.
		i) indexOf : Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specific element.
		j) size : Returns the number of components in the vector.
		k) capacity : Returns the current capacity of vector.
		
20.5	When inserting additional elements into a Vector object whose current size is less than its capacity is a relatively fast because
		it use to manipulate defualt capacity and when inserting additional elements into a Vector object whose current size is at capacity isc relatively 
		slow because if we inserting just 1 element it would increase the capacity by 100% i.e. if vector size is 10 by default and we add 11th 
		element now its capacity would be 20.  

20.7	a) A Set does not allow inserting duplicate elements. A Map does not allow using duplicate keys, but it allows inserting duplicate values for unique keys.
		b) collection store only refrences to objects. when we add primitive type to collection autoboxing occure.
		c) we can print all elements by using enhanced forLoop.
		
20.8	a) iterator : implemente collection and walk through all the elements present in collection.
		b) hasNext : iterator method return true if collection has a value otherwise return false.
		c) next : iterator method use to move to next value.

20.9	a) put : Associates the specific value with the specific key.
		b) get : Returns the value to which the specific key is mapped.
		c) isEmpty : Returns true if the map contains no key-value.
		d) containsKey : Returns true if the map contains key.
		e) keySet : Returns a Set view of the keys contained in the map

20.10	a) true
		b) true
		c) true
		
20.11	a) load : Reads a property list from the input stream.
		b) store : Writes the property list in the Properties table to the output stream.
		c) getProperty : Searches for the property with the specific key in the property list.
		d) list : Prints the property list to the specified output stream.
